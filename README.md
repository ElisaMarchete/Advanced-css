# Challenge02-Advanced-css
Advanced CSS


## Description

This Challenge is great because while practicing the new skills we built a portfolio, witch soon will be updated with real projects and applications to demonstrate during my job search.
I was able to pratice the recently learned subjects: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The most difficult part of the project was the flexbox and placing images in the site, I spent a lot of time searching and praticing to complete the challenge requiriments.
